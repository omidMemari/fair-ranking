Compas dataset can be found here: https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis

It has different versions. I realized that most of the papers use "compas-scores-two-years.csv" dataset in their experiments. 

Since I didn't know how Microsoft paper cleaned the data, I tried to see how other papers clean and use this dataset. 

I used and modified the code in this paper: "Enhancing the Accuracy and Fairness of Human Decision Making", NIPS 2018, to make the dataset clean and ready for classifier.
